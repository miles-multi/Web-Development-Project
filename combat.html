    <p style="display:inline-block"><img src="images/Combat/JUICE.webp" alt="JUICE">JUICE is used when you choose to use a skill. Every skill costs a certain amount of JUICE except for the GUARD skill. You can replenish your JUICE by using ITEMS. (JUICE cannot be lost from an attack unless your characters is SAD)</p><br>
    <p style="display:inline-block"><img src="images/Combat/HEALTH.webp" alt="HEALTH">HEALTH is the health of your character that goes down everytime they take a hit from an opponent. You can gain your HEALTH back through SKILLS, FOLLOW-UP MOVES, and ITEMS.</p><br>
    <p style="display:inline-block"><img src="images/Combat/ENERGY_BAR.webp" alt="ENERGY BAR">The ENERGY BAR is at the bottom of the screen and increases anytime a character is attacked by an opponent. Use your ENERGY BAR to do FOLLOW-UP MOVES and the ULTIMATE ATTACK.</p><br>
    <p style="display:inline-block"><img src="images/Combat/FOLLOW_UPS.webp" alt="FOLLOW-UP MOVES">FOLLOW-UP MOVES are moves you can do after you ATTACK an opponent. (FOLLOW-UP MOVES cannot be used after you use a SKILL) These moves differ from player to player and can help you in multiple scenarios.</p><br>
    <p style="display:inline-block"><img src="images/Combat/ULTIMATE_ATTACK.webp" alt="ULTIMATE ATTACK">Your ULTIMATE ATTACK is a FOLLOW-UP MOVE specific to OMORI, only OMORI can play this move after an ATTACK. The ULTIMATE ATTACK becomes accessible when you get to 10 energy and is a culmination of attacks from each main character. This does a lot of damage and comes in handy</p><br>
