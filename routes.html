    <h1>Routes</h1>
    <p>The game OMORI has many different routes you can take to experience more of less of the game. This section will describe how
        to do each route with a brief description of what you'll experience in it and its ending.</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Sunny Route</dt>
        <dd>This route is triggered when you decide to open the door and hang out with KEL everyday in FARAWAY Town. This route
            will give you more insight into what's going on in the real world and what happened years ago.<br>
        </dd>
        <dt>Neutral Endings</dt>
        <dd>These endings are obtained through both of the routes. For the Sunny Route, you will get this ending if you decide to go back to sleep instead of checking
            on Basil. There are two versions that are triggered after this based on if you decide to take a steak knife before going to bed.
            For the OMORI Route, you will automatically get this ending.
        </dd>
        <dt>OMORI Route</dt>
        <dd>This route is triggered when you decide to take a nap instead of opening the door to KEL everytime he knocks. This route will
            cause Sunny to never leave his house for the remaining 3 days and cause you to spend most of the game in Headspace.
